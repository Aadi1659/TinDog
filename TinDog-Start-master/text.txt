what is a responsive webiste?
most ppl think that being responsive means that our webiste is fast and snappy, but that isnt the case
responsive means that how well our webiste will work on different platforms like mobile, desktop and tablets.
the webiste should change accordingly and provide the user the best experience.

in bootstrap suppose we want to create some rows and columns similar to the airbnb webiste, 
which has 4 columns in desktop, 3 in tablets, and 2 in phones.

to acheive that responsiveness, what we can do is to specify the number of rows and columnswe need

eg
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6" style="background-color: red; border:1px solid" >
        col
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6" style="background-color: red; border:1px solid" >
        col
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6" style="background-color: red; border:1px solid" >
        col
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6" style="background-color: red; border:1px solid" >
        col
    </div>
</div>

lg is for large, md is for medium and sm for small ie desktop, tablets and phones respectively

the numbers 3, 4, 6 means how many columns to show up
on the screen there are 12 columns, so 3 means 12/3 ie 4 to be shown on desktops and so on...

what is a container?
a container is a bootstrap element which can adapt itself automatically and become responsive.
what it means is that it just holds the inner elements in position and as a whole becomes responsive automatically

container-fluid is a better option to the regular container as it doesn'nt jump its width

WHAT IS Z index?
 
z index is the property of any element to define its order of stacking
consider it like the z-axis of a body
the higher the z-index, the higher its stacking
note: z-index can be only implemented if the position of the body is not static


media query
media query is used for making our websites responsive
it actually adds conditions to our CSS code
syntax:
@media<type>{input}


what is code refactoring?
code refactoring means making your code more and more readable and comprehendible by others
the general priority order is
first: readablity
second: modularity
third: efficiency
fourth: length

so we should focus the most in readablity and then the others

the hiearchical order of reading elements in CSS is from right to left
eg .container-fluid .title{
    color:red;
}
it means to give title which is a class inside another class called container-fluid a red color.

if we remove the space between thw two classes ie .container-fluid.title it means to look for an element 
which has both the classes container-fluid and title.

futhermore h1.container-fluid.title means an h1 which has the class container-fluid and class title
